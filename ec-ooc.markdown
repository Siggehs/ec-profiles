Hi! If you're reading this, it means you're interested in learning about me - the player - rather than the character. If you're not interested, every other page will be thematically appropriate.

I'll start off with some basic stuff.

* I do all kinds of roleplay, and my timezone is CT - central time. I typically get off work, of which I work weekends,  at 9:00 PM.

* I value communication and transparency over frequency and dishonesty. What this means is that I've had a lot of bad experiences with people I've known for an obscene amount of time, and I've grown very impatient with the kind of things some roleplayers pull for clout. If you have a problem with anything we roleplay, I ask that you tell me, and not pretend like you're okay with it for the future.  Presumably, we're both adults, and both of us are capable of actually discussing problems. 

* If I'm online, I'm open to talking; though extended conversations would probably be best suited to **Discord (the worst dragon#4146)** due to my peanut brain's inability to keep up with pink text.
