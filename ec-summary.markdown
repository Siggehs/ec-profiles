***Know you, the weight of the heart; ***

***I will teach it to you.***

The Eccentric Savant is an oddity. Deep within the heart of the Black Shroud she can be found -- if you're keen enough. Ties severed to most of the outside world, only few will speak the names 'Kastner' here and there - though far more frequently, deep shroud-dwellers speak of her as a witch.

She is anything but.

Find yourself to her haunt, and she will regale you of her tales - or mayhap she'll just try to flirt your ears off. 

It varies between person to person.
