I'm looking for excitement. I'm looking for something new; something fresh, fun. I met a man, the other day -- I'll call him 'Ray'. He and his friends taught me about Thanalan; and I didn't know it, but I'd be staying there for a large chunk of my life. No more was I learning to stepdance, to be a proper lady -- instead, I found solace in the teachings my family scorned so: Magic. Thaumaturgy came first - and after that, conjury. I didn't like it very well - so I moved right on to arcanima. Then... I experimented.

And as I experimented, I sought more and more fanciful books; onwards, to Vylbrand, and there... I found the Eagle and Quill. The clerk -- oh, how... pretty, she was. Plump. Comfortable. A kinswoman; a Keeper. Though, they're far more common outside of Ishgard - they weren't quite as common in my eyes. I found excuse after excuse to meet her;  and eventually...

A trend started, and she left.

So, I became the new clerk of my new favorite bookstore. As time wore on, customers slowly stopped coming by.  As customers stopped coming by, I stopped reading. As I stopped reading, I started ... ... ...

Well, in any case. Eorzea is an ever-progressing land -- and those with experience who will teach you should be praised.

I didn't know that I'd meet a Grimalkin.
