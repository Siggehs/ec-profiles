Strand yourself 'mongst the ocean.

Fill your lungs with vile waters, and breathe out noxious fumes. This is how they will find you.  And when they do, they will die; for you are but a poison. But poisons will, eventually, coagulate; stuck within the lifeblood of our air, it is only natural that you'd find yourself somewhere that you simply weren't supposed to be. 

The wrong place at the wrong time. 

Even should you consent to the spiriting away, they'll take you by force regardless. They'll use your knowledge against your home. At least, what they believe to be your home.  This knowledge of such is something you, previously, simply had no time to perfect previously.  Twinkles of light amongst a sea of darkness that you're always so busy trudging through-

And yet, isn't it so strange that - sitting there, in your lab, staring at the dying crystal-flower you birthed - you feel as though you've made more progress than ever?

This is a land of shadows. A land of suppressed emotion. You will never escape.

You will die here,

with nobody to know your name.
