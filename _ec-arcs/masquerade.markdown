"The Kastner". 

What a joke.  They hired me as an aetherial specialist, and thusly refused to take on my expertise.  And so, a little girl died - and a demon went free.   Even at a school where I could teach others what little I knew over the masses, I couldn't escape the darkness around me. The stupidity. The selfishness. I grew bitter. 

A moniker was born. A mask. I wore it - physically and mentally - everywhere. 

For the eyes are mirrors to the soul. If you cannot see them, then there is no Human infront of you.
