I've always thought the rumors about black cats were silly, but one day, I was proven wrong.

I don't want to go into detail. Just thinking about it now makes my head spin. The drugs. The changes. The desperation I went through to get what I wanted; to feel as though I belonged. None of it worked. In the seedy underbelly of Eorzea's society lies true cruelty; Humankind of such passionately dispassionate degree that it makes me sick to the stomach. 

And I was a part of it all. 

I hurt people. Good people. I've killed, maimed, tortured; I've seen the light leave innocent people's eyes as they wondered: "Why is this happening to me?" I wish I could say they're faces I'll never forget.  I wish I could go back and stop myself from going down such a dark path. 

But wishes don't come true. Not even if you wish upon the Evenstar.
