Even devils speak truth, now and again. Even they can crack the mask of self-anonymity; the veil of which shrouds even the soul. 

Fear is a powerful emotion. It is a constant that Human beings must overcome at any point in time; or flee from. It is what makes us who we are. 

But when your fear drives you to do things that simply have no merit, you can lose sight of your being.  You no longer know what is Human anymore -- so much so that you can deign to view the devil before you as one.  Stripped of your identity, you'll be given one - by a band of misfits haphazardly fit together by none other than yourself. 

And they'll fight. They'll grind; tooth and nail, to see that your heart stays intact. That thing with literal and metaphorical holes inside of it...

Whether you want them to or not.
