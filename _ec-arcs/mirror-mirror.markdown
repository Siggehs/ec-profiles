A fortress made of black and white.  A building - hollow - transparent from the outside, yet solid from the inside. A paradox.

When your goal is complete, who are you? What are you to do?

When you live only because it would make others sad for you to disappear, where will you go? How will you get there?

When the world is naught but monochrome, and your claim to greatness is stripped of you - ye Martyr, ye - 

What happens now?

Who are you?
