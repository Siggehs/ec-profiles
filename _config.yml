Charter-Trigger-Text: Stranger Campaigns
Charter-Title: Highly WIP!
Charter-Description: "Hey there, glad you clicked! This is HIGHLY work in progress,
  so keep that in mind as you read. \n\nStranger Campaigns are, in short, a project
  I'm going to run with the goal of making the FFXIV Roleplay community less insular
  and exclusive; encouraging people to make new connections, and get out of their
  bubbles. The name of the game is this: You sign up (IN-CHARACTER), you get added
  to the roster of names, and once signups are over, a deliberation period will begin.
  Your name, alongside an y others who signed up in-character at the appointed date,
  will be carefully considered alongside everyone else's, and after a time, a party
  will be made. **It is very likely that you will not have met your party members
  before, and that is the entire point of the schtick.** If everyone's attendance
  is confirmed and no further deliberation is needed, everyone in your party - including
  you - gets a specifically-built plotline, constructed around the dynamics that might
  fit well for each character. TL;DR: D&D lite, but in FFXIV. This means a few things:
  One, this plot is going to be built from the ground up the moment everyone is confirmed
  to be able to participate - by me. 'Me' being the player of Ivalinne Duratoix, Didizi
  Dizi, Skittish Scholar and Eccentric Savant.  You can contact me on any of these
  characters at all with questions, or you can add me on discord at \"the worst dragon#4146\"
  - this page will be refined over time, and probably given a more easy description.
  Thanks for reading if you got this far!"
