Hi! If you're reading this, it means you're interested in learning about me - the player - rather than the character. If you're not interested, every other page will be thematically appropriate.

Here are some things you should probably know about me:

* I do all kinds of roleplay, and my timezone is CT - central time. I typically get off work, of which I work weekends,  at 9:00 PM.

* I value communication and transparency over frequency and dishonesty. What this means is that I've had a lot of bad experiences with some really bad people. If you have a problem with anything we roleplay, I ask that you tell me, and not pretend like you're okay with it - and then spread gross rumors.  Presumably, we're both adults, and both of us are capable of actually discussing problems. 

* If I'm online, I'm open to talking; though extended conversations would probably be best suited to **Discord (the worst dragon#4146)** due to my peanut brain's inability to keep up with pink text.  

* **I am not my character. IC/OOC bleeding is a big fat zero tolerance. Just because you smooched my character on the lips doesn't mean we're married.**

* All of my characters operate under the assumption that both parties are above age 18 out-of-character. Please do not approach me if you're a minor; no offense, but my characters often have mature themes tied with them.
